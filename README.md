Zendo
=====

[Zendo](http://www.looneylabs.com/rules/zendo) is an inductive logic game.
The game can be played using any kind of game pieces.
IRL, the game is usually played with [Looney Pyramids](http://www.looneylabs.com/looney-pyramids),
but this implementation uses poker cards.

Requires node 0.11 or higher, with the harmony proposal turned on.

    node --harmony /usr/local/bin/grunt

Then open index.html in your browser.
